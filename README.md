# React-Code-Challenge
Create a single page web application. It only needs to work on “evergreen”  browsers. Choose one of these frame works.  ● React (https://facebook.github.io/react/)  ● Polymer (https://www.polymer­project.org/1.0/)  ● Angular 2.0 (https://angular.io/)  ● Meteor (https://www.meteor.com/) &lt;­ this is actually a platform!  You don’t need to worry about persisting data in a database (unless you want to).  The web app should have  ● a file input that lets a choose a image from their local box  ● an HTML element that displays that image  ● a list of of Available Actions that can be applied to that image  ○ rotate 45 degrees  ○ translate x by ­40px  ○ scale to 0.5  ○ opacity to 0.5  ● feel free to make the Actions more fun if you want.  ● a list of the Actions that are applied to the image  ● the user should be able to apply an Action which moves it from the Available list to the  Applied list and modifies the image.  ● the user should be able to un­apply an Action which moves it back to the Available list  and removes the action from the image.  ● a reset button that resets everything back to the start
